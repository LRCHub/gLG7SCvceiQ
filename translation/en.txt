[00:25.94] There's no despair at all Truth is harmless In a mirage where reality doesn't exist, that's how it is
[00:32.49] Even if my existence were erased, it wouldn't matter to me— nothing but inconveniences. My brain's already shattered.
[00:38.84] Education never acknowledges my true self It just keeps pushing problems with no right answers onto me
[00:44.98] "I don't understand anything." Yes, I'm shouting alone.
[00:52.54] Living for someone else
[00:58.64] Wasting away my limited life

[01:10.79] To whom should I make amends, and to what extent?
[01:15.46] I don't get it.
[01:17.04] Hurt, hurt
[01:18.61] It hurts, it's so painful.
[01:20.23] I'm drowning in helpless feelings, tears blurring my vision so I can't even see ahead.
[01:28.66] Everything seems like it might vanish

[02:19.40] It takes a long time to break down preconceived notions of what's right.
[02:25.79] How am I supposed to live up to such cruel expectations?
[02:30.26] I don't get it.
[02:32.19] Hurt, hurt
[02:33.47] It hurts, it's so painful.
[02:35.02] Live on, no matter what
[02:36.62] With no tears left, I've become evil.
[02:43.27] Everything will vanish
[02:47.77] 
[03:02.07] Everything will vanish
